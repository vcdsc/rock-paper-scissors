# Rock, Paper, Scissors

## Description

This is a JavaScript practice project. The main goals were:

- Train the ability to pseudocode a problem.
- By pseudocoding a larger problem, see how it is possible to break it into more manageable pieces of work.
- Write functional code based on our findings.
- Practice the use of `for` loops, conditional logic and introducing the concept of randomness with `Math.random()`.
- Finally, code a functional game of rock, paper, scissors, that:
  - runs on the browser
  - prompts the user for their input
  - handles input correctly (game should handle the usual rules of rock, paper, scissors correctly)
  - displays an alert message for incorrect input
  - keeps track of ties, wins and losses
  - displays ties, wins and losses once user finishes or cancels the game
